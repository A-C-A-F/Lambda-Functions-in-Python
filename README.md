# Lambda-Functions-in-Python
Where, Why, and How of Lambda Functions in Python

In this project we are going to learn about lambda expressions and it's application in python. We are going to start with what is Lambda expression and how we can define it, comparing lambda functions with regular functions in python and at the end we will learn how to use lambda functions for data manipulation and exploration in pandas.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ What is Lambda expression?
- __Task 2:__ Lambda expressions and lists
- __Task 3:__ Lambda expressions combined if else statement
- __Task 4:__ Lambda expressions and sorting
- __Task 5:__ Data Manipulation and Exploration using Lambda Expressions
